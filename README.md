# TicTacToe

The goal of this game was to create a very basic tic tac toe game in the browser that could be played
by two people on the same computer. The main skills this game was meant to practice were incorporating
jQuery and creating an internal state for the game that would be output onto the screen after every
turn. User actions update the state which is then output onto the screen rather than having user actions
directly modify the html.
